Flags per Video

For each video, find how many unique users flagged it. A unique user can be identified using the combination of their first name and last name. Do not consider rows in which there is no flag ID.




SELECT 
    video_id,
    count(DISTINCT concat(COALESCE(user_firstname, ''), COALESCE(user_lastname, ''))) num_unique_users
FROM user_flags AS uf
WHERE flag_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY video_id
