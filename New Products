Write a query to count the net difference between the number of products companies launched in 2020 with the number of products companies launched in the previous year. Output the name of the companies and a net difference of net products released for 2020 compared to the previous year.



WITH ProductCounts AS (
    SELECT
        company_name,
        CASE WHEN year = 2020 THEN '2020' ELSE '2019' END AS launch_year,
        COUNT(*) AS num_products
    FROM
        car_launches
    GROUP BY
        company_name, launch_year
)

SELECT
    company_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN launch_year = '2020' THEN num_products ELSE 0 END) -
    SUM(CASE WHEN launch_year = '2019' THEN num_products ELSE 0 END) AS net_products
FROM
    ProductCounts
GROUP BY 
    company_name;
