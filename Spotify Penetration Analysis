Market penetration is an important metric for understanding Spotify's performance and growth potential in different regions.
You are part of the analytics team at Spotify and are tasked with calculating the active user penetration rate in specific countries.


For this task, 'active_users' are defined based on the  following criterias:


last_active_date: The user must have interacted with Spotify within the last 30 days.
•    sessions: The user must have engaged with Spotify for at least 5 sessions.
•    listening_hours: The user must have spent at least 10 hours listening on Spotify.


Based on the condition above, calculate the active 'user_penetration_rate' by using the following formula.


•    Active User Penetration Rate = (Number of Active Spotify Users in the Country / Total users in the Country)


Total Population of the country is based on both active and non-active users.
​
The output should contain 'country' and 'active_user_penetration_rate' rounded to 2 decimals.


Let's assume the current_day is 2024-01-31.




WITH active_users AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        country
    FROM
        penetration_analysis
    WHERE
        last_active_date >= DATE '2024-01-01'  -- Within the last 30 days from 2024-01-31
        AND sessions >= 5
        AND listening_hours >= 10
),
total_users AS (
    SELECT
        country,
        COUNT(user_id) AS total_users
    FROM
        penetration_analysis
    GROUP BY
        country
),
active_user_count AS (
    SELECT
        country,
        COUNT(user_id) AS active_users
    FROM
        active_users
    GROUP BY
        country
)
SELECT
    t.country,
    COALESCE(
        ROUND(CAST(a.active_users AS NUMERIC) / t.total_users * 100, 2),
        0
    ) AS active_user_penetration_rate
FROM
    total_users t
LEFT JOIN
    active_user_count a ON t.country = a.country
ORDER BY
    active_user_penetration_rate DESC;
