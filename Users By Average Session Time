[Users By Average Session Time](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10352-users-by-avg-session-time?code_type=1)
Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit, with an obvious restriction that load time event should happen before exit time event . Output the user_id and their average session time.

WITH all_user_sessions AS (
    SELECT 
        t1.user_id, 
        t1.timestamp::DATE AS date, 
        MIN(t2.timestamp) - MAX(t1.timestamp) AS session_duration
    FROM 
        facebook_web_log t1 
    JOIN 
        facebook_web_log t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id 
    WHERE 
        t1.action = 'page_load' 
        AND t2.action = 'page_exit' 
        AND t2.timestamp > t1.timestamp 
    GROUP BY 
        t1.user_id , t1.timestamp::DATE
)
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    AVG(EXTRACT(SECOND FROM session_duration)) AS average_session_time
FROM 
    all_user_sessions
GROUP BY 
    user_id;


Output


user_id	average_session_time
0	23.5
1	35
