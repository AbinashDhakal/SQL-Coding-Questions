[Finding User Purchases](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10322-finding-user-purchases?code_type=1)

Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.

SELECT 
    DISTINCT(t1.user_id)
FROM
    amazon_transactions t1
JOIN 
    amazon_transactions t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id 
AND 
    t1.id <> t2.id
AND
    t2.created_at::date - t1.created_at::date BETWEEN 0 AND 7 
ORDER BY 
    t1.user_id;
